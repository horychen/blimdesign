Steps:

At design phase 2, specify tangential stress and machine constant.
The former is used to determine motor size, and the latter is for determining linear current density A according to the air gap B.

Choose a zQs. It will affect your air gap B.

At design phase 12, choose the correct magnetic material you want to use: Arnon5 or M19Gauge29

At design phase 11, Check the current density specified on the design, especially the rotor current density.
The current density should be chosen according to your cooling method.
A hot rotor should be avoided.
